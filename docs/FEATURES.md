# Hive feature inventory

The native and web agent core runs locally. This inventory describes the current implementation and remaining extensions. Live providers and optional infrastructure require separate configuration and validation.

## Implemented coverage

| Area | Current implementation | Remaining extension |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chat / delegated work | Native CopilotKit chat, server tools, durable tasks and confirmed outcomes | Live model/provider acceptance testing |
| Task review and brief | Agent work waits In Review until a person marks it done or sends it back with a note; the agent cannot close a task. Notes and files (PDF, images, text) on every task are read by each run, and notes added to a running task reach its session | Acceptance testing of live notes against a real `opencode serve` |
| Channel files | A Files browser per channel (recent changes, folders, upload) with previews by kind; the agent shares files as cards (`send_file`) and asks for them with an upload button and modal (`request_upload`); expiring links keep their scope in the path, and a web page runs in a sandbox with its own folder | Delete/rename and drag and drop; relative images in Markdown; native video/audio player |
| Ideas / personal context | Source-backed mail/goal rules, accept/edit/dismiss, identity, editable/forgettable memories | Broader model-derived cross-connector suggestions |
| Goals / Tracking | Milestones, recurring watches, observations, retry/backoff, pause and cancellation | Adaptive long-term planning and calendar-driven reminders |
| Browser | Persistent Chromium, public page reads, snapshots, console takeover, PDF downloads | Autonomous interactive booking and per-person VM orchestration |
| Gmail / Calendar | Google OAuth; complete threads; saved drafts; calendar/event CRUD with reviewed versions | Live Google acceptance, recurrence editing, other connectors |
| PDF job | Durable import, typed input request, filled-copy preview, reviewed reply, receipt | OCR/scanned forms and additional PDF field types |
| Generated results | Plans/reports/comparisons, finance CSV metrics, and scripts saved as artifacts | Managed tool installation/versioning and image/audio generation |
| Notifications | Durable in-app inbox, source-linked change alerts, restart reconciliation | APNs/FCM/device push delivery |
| Connectors | Searchable capability/status catalogue, Google connection, browser worker | Plaid, health, Instagram, WhatsApp and partner APIs |
| OpenBot | Disabled adapter with pinned protocol/identity tests | Live session bridge, routines and computer backend wiring |

The implementation and validation details are in [VERIFICATION.md](VERIFICATION.md). Planned extensions are not claims of current support. Priorities are tracked in the [roadmap](../ROADMAP.md).
